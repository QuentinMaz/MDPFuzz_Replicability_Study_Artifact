We failed to set up the Python virtual environment when we followed the initial instructions.
Instead, we had to:
- Extract from the .yml file the pip requirements (now in requirements.txt).
- Comment the tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0 package.
- Comment the pip installation part of the .yml file.
- Create the virtual environment and activate it.
- Install the pip packages dumped in requirements.txt with pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Once pip itself is updated (pip==20.3.4 is among the packages installed), install the commented package with pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0.
- Install pandas package with pip install pandas.
